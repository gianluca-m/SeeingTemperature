# "Seeing" Temperature - Integration of IR Camera into the HoloLens 2

Mixed Reality course (2021@ETH Zurich) student project

## Description

The goal of this project is to display the thermal information of people to the user by integrating an infra-red camera connected to a Raspberry Pi computer into the HoloLens 2 system. In the end, the HoloLens will have all the information needed to detect potential temperature hazards and make them visible. The idea behind the project is to develop an  application that helps detecting potential Covid-19 threads e.g in hospitals, airports, workplaces and other places with a high infection risk.
